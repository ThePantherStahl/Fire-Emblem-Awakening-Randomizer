Fire Emblem Awakening Randomizer - BETA VERION
-----------------------------------------------
A Fire Emblem Awakening Randomizer that attempts to swap in game content
for a more varied experience.
Do note that this is a BETA version, which means it will be prone to
difficulties and crashes. ONLY USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Features
-----------------------------------------------
-Swap the classes of in-game playable characters
-Swap the Join order of in-game playable characters
*NOTE*
-Script editing thus far is NOT supported, which means if you decide to
swap characters, if they are nps or enemies, you will not be able to
recruit them without manual script editing.

Instructions
-----------------------------------------------
1. Obtain Awakening's romf folder. If you don't know how to do that, google it.
2. Create a temporary folder to store your files in. (It is reccomended you keep
a backup of the files before you modify them)
3. Out of the romfs folder, take data/dispos and data/person and place them into
your new folder. (You can take the entire data folder, but it's not necesary)
4. Open FEAT (Fire Emblem Archive Tool) and drag the data folder into it. Again,
if you don't know what FEAT is, google it.
5. Open the Fire Emblem Awakening Randomizer jar file. 
6. Select the temporary folder.
7. Choose the options you wish to enable.
8. Hit Randomize. (Right now, the application will not indicate if randomization
is complete. To know if your files are done, check the date modified)
9. Once your files have been randomized, drag data into FEAT one last time.
10. You're done! Drag your files into your patching app of choice (Luma, ntr, hans) 
and enjoy!
