Instructions
-----------------------------------------------
1. Obtain Awakening's romf folder. If you don't know how to do that, google it.
2. Create of the romfs folder and keep it somwhere safe. You should keep this copy as
backup in case something goes wrong.
3. Take the romfs folder and place it in the same folder where the randomizer 
application is.
4. Open FEAT (Fire Emblem Archive Tool) and drag the romfs folder into it. Again,
if you don't know what FEAT is, google it.
5. Open the Fire Emblem Awakening Randomizer jar file. 
6. Select the romfs folder. (If you get an error saying that some files are missing then 
either: Some files ARE missing, get a copy of the original unmodified backup of romfs you
made and try again. You've accidentally selected something other than the romfs folder.
Or your file structure is incorrect. Make sure that you rename none of the folders inside roms
[romfs itself is fine to change] or any of the files, as well as make sure they are in the same
order thay came in).
7. Choose the options you wish to enable.
8. Hit Randomize. Once it is done, green text indicating that randomization was completed
will appear. If you get red text instead, it means that randomization failed at some point.
Delete the romfs folder and try it again using a new copy of your backed up romfs folder.
9. Once your files have been randomized, drag data into FEAT one last time.
10. You're done! Drag your files into your patching app of choice (Luma, ntr, hans) 
and enjoy!
